Linear Location Estimation

A linear 1-D track where the agent can decide when to accelerate and decelerate. The goal is to reach and stop at the 
goal’s location with minimal time. The agent’s observation on its own location has a noise, and this noise will increase
proportional to the distance of agent from the starting point. When the agent is close to the goal, this noise will be 
reset and kept as 0, which mimic the situation when the agent can actual see the goal clearly.

Action Space
The agent only has three action state: do nothing, accelerate or decelerate at a fixed acceleration.

End condition
First, the agent needs to stop at the reward zone, which is 1 unit away from the starting point and has a length of 0.1 unit.
After the agent successfully stops at the reward zone, it is then required to reach the end of the track.

Installation
User only needs to install the modified version of gym from GitHub.
